## ðŸ‘¦ About

I am Master of Science in Computer Science. <br />
I happily and successfully completed the CodersCamp and DaftAcademy course, where I developed my front-end skills. <br />
I am fully focused to progress my skills such as JavaScript, React, Jest and Typescript and I am looking for a job (Junior Front-End Developer) where I can face new challenges. <br />
In my spare time, I grow myself in mobile photography. <br />
In the section below you can see some of my recent projects.
